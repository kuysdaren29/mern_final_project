    "It's worth making time to find the things that really stir your soul. Thats what makes you really feel alive. You have to say no to other things you're used to, and do it with all your heart. - Roy T. Bennett",
    "Sooner or later every writer evolves his own definition of a story. Mine is: A reflection of life plus beginning and end (life seems not to have either) and a meaning.",
    "Read, read, read. Read everything — trash, classics, good and bad, and see how they do it. Just like a carpenter who works as an apprentice and studies the master. Read! You'll absorb it. Then write. If it's good, you'll find out. If it's not, throw it out of the window.",
    "Good writing is supposed to evoke sensation in the reader – not the fact that it is raining, but the feeling of being rained upon"
